# Hi there, I'm Tomisin Olusesi! 👋

### ☁️ Cloud Architecture Engineer Enthusiast
I’m a builder who's obsessed with the "Big Picture." I enjoy taking messy, monolithic ideas and turning them into scalable, resilient, and automated cloud-native realities.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Mastering Terraform modules and multi-region failover strategies.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Advanced Kubernetes orchestration and FinOps (because those cloud bills won't optimize themselves).
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Open-source IaC templates or cloud security projects.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Why I think Serverless is the future, or my favorite AWS/Azure/GCP services.
- ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I believe every problem in life can be solved with a well-configured Load Balancer.
